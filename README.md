# portfolioWebsiteTemplate
<h1>Hey, and Welcome!</h1>
<p>
This is a website portfolio template where users don't need to code to update their page!. <br>
Users can register/login to create work experience or project/other experiences posts or edit existing ones, while dynamically updating their web page.<br>
The process to set this up should take about 30 min.
</p>

<h1>The Setup</h1>
<ol>
<li>Clone/download the repository</li>
<li>Delete the .git file in the repository and initialize a new repository on your github.<li>
<li>Push this repo to your git</li>
</ol>

<h1>Setting Up your Heroku Account</h1>
<p>
If you don't already know what Heroku is or have an account, now is a good time!<br>
Heroku is a free resource to host your web applications that have a back end, and we will utilize their add-on features to connect to their mongodb.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://signup.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and create an account</li>
<li>Add your credit card or any card (It doesn't charge unless you want to upgrade to a better server, but the standard is still really good!)</li>
<li>Head to your <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps">Dashboard</a> and create a new app.</li>
<li>After creating your app name (Beware, your app name is your <app name>.herokuapp.com), head to the Resources tab</li>
